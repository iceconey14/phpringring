# phpringring
a php script that is compatible with mysql, mongodb, sqlite, or postgresql.
# how to install
go to install.php and choose whatever the hell you want.
# what are the urls
they are pretty ugly, (e.g., next.php?id=123 index.php?page=list prev.php?id=123) but you can fix that in the .htacsess file.
# how to add a site
go to addsite.php and set the password inside it (look for $ADD_PASSWORD ), unless you want unwanted websites in your webring, and then remember it, or look in the file,
now, go to the password form, and enter the password you set with the $ADD_PASSWORD variable, and then you now have a form, which you can add your websites to.

i know this is SUPER basic but this is the best i could do with my crappy php skills
